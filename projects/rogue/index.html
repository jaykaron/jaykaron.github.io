      <h5>Intro:</h5>
      <p>
        A roguelike I made with <strong>Java</strong> as a final project high-school. For an introduction to roguelikes
        see this <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-roguelikes-4117411" title="Lifewire: The Beginner's Guide to Roguelikes">Lifewire article</a>
        or watch my introduction video. My game is heavily based off the game <a href="http://www.adom.de/home/index.html" title="ADOM Homepage">ADOM</a>,
        one of my favourite games of all time.

      <h5>Programming Highlight: Maps</h5>
      <p>
        With over 3000 lines of code, there was a lot of interesting stuff, but my favorite part was
        the procedurally generated maps.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are 3 distinct dungeon layouts, each with a unique generation algorithm. <strong>Cave</strong>  (cellular automaton), <strong>Rooms</strong> (recursive, divide & conquer)
        and <strong>Maze</strong> (recursive). Watch the video below to see how they work.

      <h5>Download:</h5>
      <p class="long">
        You can download the <a href="content/rogue.jar">JAR File</a> and if you have Java installed run it
        with this command <code>java -jar rogue.jar</code> (may not work with all versions of Java).
        Roguelikes are known for their notoriously steep learning curves, so the only tip you are getting is that
        <kbd>c</kbd> shows the controls.

## Description
Doctor and professor of medicine Matt McCarthy writes a memoir of his 
first year as a resident doctor (with the occasional flashback to med school) 
as he struggles to become a _real_ doctor. Not much of a premise but gripping nonetheless.


## The Good
The writing style was light and often humorous. The author did a good job of
avoiding overloading the readers with too much medical detail. 

## The Bad
While not really the fault of the author, The intro to the book mentions that 
of course details had been changed to protect the privacy of the patients. 
This detracted from connecting to the characters because I couldn’t be sure 
what exactly was true about them. Was the teenager from Washington heights 
really as described or were details changed (and perhaps creative liberties taken) for the sake of privacy?

# Chroma
Way back in 2014, my brother made a game in Java for a final school project and since then Java applets have fallen a bit out of style. <br>
After fiddling around a bit with JavaScript, I realized that maybe it is time for __*Chroma*__ to return.

The game is a fairly simple side-scroller with a catch, to land on a platform you have to be the same colour as it.
